## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size - 375px - 1440px
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements - I only added a hover state based on the colors provided in the style guide.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup? No, it's all div's. I did try to keep it clean and use clear BEM for my classes and id's
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox - I tried to keep it DRY as possible
- Mobile-first workflow - built at 375px break at 768px
- media queries - my CSS gets a little sloppy in the product-content @media (min-width: 768px)

### What I learned

This is my second frontendmentor challenge. I did this one mobile first with flexbox. The code is fairly clean at 375px. I do mix px and rem. After the media query I started "eyeballing" some of the individual elements with padding and margins. I would like to see how my solution holds up to the design.

### Continued development

Their has to be a better way than "eyeballing" padding and margins. Possibly a combination of grid and flexbox? I am not certain.

## Acknowledgments

- Hey @vcarames. It's been 3 months already? These are really fun and challenging for me. I really should try to do one a week along with my other projects. How are you?
